# KOMODO NOTARY NODE PROPOSAL
We propose our candidacy as Notary Node (NN) on behalf of Marmara Community. This year, we are planning to manage Notary position again in **EU Region**.

* As Marmara Team, we responded quickly to the update announcements in notarization system. We always kept our server up and running with the daily updates. 
* As Marmara Community, we have been trying to create awareness of Komodo Technologies at university and community level. It goes back to Barterdex days where we were conducting Atomic Swap tests at Marmara University. 
* Last year, for more than 6 months, we have conducted two different TV program series on Local Television broadcasting also in EU region. At each program, we focused on Komodo Technologies such as using AtomicDEX, Komodo Technologies in general and Marmara Chain as one of the smart chains in Komodo ecosystem. We have made an exclusive interview with Komodo CTO Kadan on one [TV Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spcDdznPOxI) and [conducted swaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6CFVEu2NFs&t=1291s) and [credit loops at international level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnPYprNdcLs&t=13s) on a live broadcast. The total number of TV shows exceeds 20 programs.
* [Marmara Discord](https://marmara.io/discord) group has now more than 4000 members. We provide support with special channels for Komodo, Pirate, Tokel, Verus and other projects on ecosystem. The efforts continue to raise awareness at different regions in Turkey. Our position as being a notary node operator run by Marmara Chain officialy helps us promote the Komodo Notarization system and its Technologies in the region. 
* Our Marmara Team now has close relations with Komodo team members in cross-functional teams. 
* We as Marmara Chain now maintain the non-geo blocking version of AtomicDEX. We are planning to integrate AtomicDEX Web or mobile versions in future with credit functionalities in MCL Phase 1 and 2.
* We currently run two offices one in the Technopark Istanbul near the Sabiha Gökçen International Airport and othe other office as being in the city centre located in the middle of two campuses of Marmara University. We have close relations with the University incubation center to meet the startup companies with the Komodo blockchain technologies.  
* We intend to spread end-to-end solutions of Komodo technologies to a very large audience and make Marmara Region a blockchain hub not only in Turkey but also in the neighboring regions.
* We teach the Komodo technologies at different courses as undergraduate, graduate and community courses. In this year, we are planning to create an advanced course content to teach crypto conditions, the way to create custom consensus smart contracts build with Komodo test chains. Advanced courses will help spread Komodo Technologies at enterprise level.
* We started training programs towards understanding of fundamentals of Blockchain systems comprising mainly of Komodo Technologies, AtomicDEX, etc both at theoretical and implementation level. 
* We promote ecosystem projects among community through the workshops both at university and outside as well as on social media.      
* Our adventure with Komodo started more than 4 years ago. The history and more information may be found in (https://marmara.io/history) With the popularity, we intend to spread the use cases of Komodo in Turkey. 
* We present Komodo Technologies’ power by referring to complex problem solutions in Marmara Chain, i.e. MCL with custom consensus smart contracts that are executing centuries old complex credit functions. 


# WHY CANDIDACY FOR NOTARY NODE?
* The complexity and nature of Marmara Credit Loops requires our Marmara community get involved in many parts of end-to-end solutions in Komodo technologies. The notarization process will help understanding Komodo Technologies more and spread the word to all communities in Turkey and in the neighboring countries.
* The Protocol 2 in MCL requires escrowship which is a kind of notarization system to settle down the nonredemption problem in p2p credits. The large level of experience via Notarization system in Komodo will help us establish  the escrow system requirements.
* The experience and reputation will help us to establish an educational center for developing Komodo way of Smart Contracts known as Crypto Conditions at Marmara University, other universities and technoparks. While we establish this center, notarization is one of the key services for showing the affiliation with Komodo. Therefore, we feel that our community should be involved in this technology so that we can provide benefits of dPoW to other projects in region.
* We strongly believe that Marmara community should and will be competent and strong to get involved in many potential projects in the near future by having talented people in Crypto Conditions, Smart Contracts by Komodo. 

### Being elected as a notary node in Season 7 will strengthen our position to achieve those objectives and activities listed above. Therefore, we appreciate the support from the community in Komodo ecosystem.

# MARMARA CHAIN HISTORY
Marmara Credit Loops (MCL) is the fruit of the famous Komodo Platform and Marmara Open Innovations Lab (MINS LAB) at Marmara University based on a real use case running almost half of GDP both in Turkey and India as well as the neighboring countries to Turkey.

The story of Marmara Chain goes back to 2010 when seeking an interest-free and peer-to-peer alternative to credits in banking where banks create money out of thin air resulting in an unfair economical and social system. The three articles explain the major problems in banking systems [[1](https://www.academia.edu/9234489/DEBT_BASED_MONETARY_SYSTEM),[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521915001477),[3](https://www.michaeljournal.org/articles/social-credit/item/the-money-myth-exploded)]. A [town story](https://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/06/15/an-amusing-brainteaser) during TV series in 2013 triggered the already existing alternative happening for decades known as post-dated cheques and promissory notes in Turkey. Those post-dated checks work as analog blockchain in real-economy on a peer-to-peer credit creation basis without bearing any interest. We conducted several workshops by Open Innovation Labs at Marmara University to bring business people and academics together. Post-dated cheques and promissory notes as inspiration to project were analzyed to find out the problems with many case studies based on interviews. Then in 2016, we started the conceptual framework at Marmara University Open Innovation Laboratory. At the end of extensive research, we discovered that the project could only be realized by an independent chain with a mineable/stakeable coin supporting advanced way of smart contracts based on multilaw principles due to multi-cultural requirements in the system. During research the article titled as [Declaration of Independence](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1372879.0) by James Lee, `jl777c#5810`, the founder of Komodo platform attracted us towards the Komodo Platform where we discussed the complexities of the work with James Lee and how to solve the problems. We established a partnership to realize the project. Based on the first [academic paper](https://www.academia.edu/40504137/Marmara_Credit_Loops_A_Blockchain_Solution_to_Nonredemption_problem_in_Post_dated_Cheques) for MCL, the initial PoC was developed in 2019 by James Lee, the co-founder of Marmara and tests were carried out by hundreds of engineering students and some researchers. Many test chains were established to fine tune the system until the mainnet was started in 17th January, 2020. 

The version 1 in Phase 1 works smoothly for more than 2 years with 100% collateralization mode. The initial version shows what is possible and it will be expanding in its popularity when the second version will be released. The second version will be a complete alternative as an interest-free credit creation and circulation while transferring virtually any credits existing on paper such as post-dated checks, promissory notes etc. The project focuses on solving the greatest problems such as non-redemption, fraud, traceability, indivisibility. Solution in Version 2 will be a partial collateralization system assured by the decentralized communities in different regions similar to Komodo Notarization System.
